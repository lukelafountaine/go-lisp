# go-lisp

This project is my second iteration of the lisp interpreter that I wrote in my Programming Language Design class in college.

[Here](https://github.com/lukelafountaine/ci-lisp) is the original interpreter that I wrote in school. This rewrite was to improve on my first interpreter as well as to learn Golang.
